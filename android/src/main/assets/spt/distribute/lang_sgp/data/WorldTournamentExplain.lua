The tournament consists both cross-server competitions and regional-server competitions. 
The cross-server competitions include: The Big Ear Cup of Big Clubs and the Small Ear Cup of Big Clubs. 
The regional-server competitions include: The Super League, the Champions League, the League One, the Secondary League, and the Regional League. 
Players are qualified to participate in the tournament in the new season if they have played the Super League, the Champions League, the League One, and the Secondary League in the current regional-server tournament. 
Other players have to be ranked in the top 150 of the sky ladder in their corresponding regions before they can participate in the Regional League games of the regional-server competitions of the tournament. Players have to obtain certain ranks in the lower league to be qualified for promotion to a higher league. There is no promotion for players in the Super League and top players are qualified for cross-server competitions:  Playing against other players for the final champions of the Big Ear Cup of Big Clubs and the Small Ear Cup of Big Clubs. 
<color=#FFFE5EFF>The Prevention mechanism of match-fixing: The system automatically determines the combat strength differences between the players' tournament line-up and their full line-up (which is their strongest line-up historically). Those players with large differences may be determined as match-fixing teams. Teams with significant differences fail immediately. Twenty regional-server points are deducted directly from players in the leagues of the regional-server competitions. Players in the cross-server competitions are eliminated immediately and loose their opportunities to participate in the next season of the cross-server competitions.</color>

Players are able to participate in the cross-server competitions by obtaining allocated spots or going through qualifying matches. 
First of all, players have to play play-off games of cross-server competitions. A total of 64 teams, which include both winning teams of the play-off games and direct advanced teams, join together to participate in the regular games of the Big Ear Cup/the Small Ear Cup of Big Clubs. 
According to the accumulated points in the past four seasons (points are determined by players' performance in the cross-server competitions in previous four seasons), each of 64 teams is assigned to one of four levels. Four teams in the same level are selected randomly into one group and there are 16 groups in total. 
The single round robin system is used in the group stage and each team plays three games. The top two teams advance to the knockout stage. 
The promotion rules of the group stage:
1. Those with more points rank high. 
2. Those with more goal differences in the group stage rank high. 
3. Those with more goals rank high. 
4. For tie teams, their win-lose ratio, goal differences and total goals are used for ranking. 
5. Teams with higher points get promoted for tie teams. 
Two teams from each group get promoted and are drawn to play knockout stage games. 
Players from both sides play knockout stage at the same time and their total scores are used for ranking. In case their total scores are equal, the goals that players score when they control the game (goals scored at home/goals scored at away) are used for ranking. A penalty shootout is arranged for the final winner players with the same scores when they control the game.
